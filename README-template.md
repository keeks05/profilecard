## My process
1. Work from the things I did not know how to do

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```CSS - Flex
- align-items: controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis
- align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content itemss along the cross-axis
** So just the elements versus the lines and how they are arranged ** ' ```

```CSS - Background properties
- background-image: url("blahzie") - "The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element"

- background-position: "The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is relative to the position layer set by background-origin"

- background-repeat: "The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated"

- background-color: sets the background color of an element

```
- This was my first small project using html and css so it was fine
